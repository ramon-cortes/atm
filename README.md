### ATM Exercise

Basic ATM exercise. Simulates a bank website where the user can *deposit* and *withdraw* money from it.

It has validation to prevent negative numbers to be used and to withdraw more money than there is in the account.

#### 1 Bug corrected (or workedaround)

Still has some bugs, but I corrected the bug from the original exercise where you can continue to withdraw money if you do not change the amount of the value.

I made a workaround just to clear the input value after each submit
